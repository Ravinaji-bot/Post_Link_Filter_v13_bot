## Deploy On Render

<p>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Render-Docker%20Deploy-46E3B7?style=for-the-badge&logo=render&logoColor=white" alt="Render Deploy">
</p>

1. Fork or upload this repository to GitHub.
2. Create a new Render Web Service.
3. Select Docker as the runtime.
4. Add the required environment variables from the table above.
5. Deploy the service.

Render must receive a valid `PORT` environment variable or use the default `8080`. If stream links use your Render domain, set:

```env
FQDN=your-app-name.onrender.com
HAS_SSL=True
NO_PORT=True
```

## Deploy On Heroku

<p>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Heroku-Supported-430098?style=for-the-badge&logo=heroku&logoColor=white" alt="Heroku Supported">
</p>

This repository includes `app.json`, `Procfile`, and `heroku.yml`, so it can also run on Heroku-style deployments.

1. Create a Heroku app.
2. Add the required environment variables.
3. Deploy this repository.
4. Ensure the worker or web process is enabled according to your hosting setup.

## Deploy With Docker

<p>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-Build%20%26%20Run-2496ED?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white" alt="Docker Build">
</p>

Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t dreamxbotz .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 dreamxbotz
```

For Docker Compose, `.env` is optional at compose-load time, but the bot still needs required variables from `.env` or your shell environment.

## Local Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file from the example and add your configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then run:

```bash
python bot.py
```

### Bot admin commands (`ADMINS`) - `/admin_cmd`

`/stats` `/users` `/chats` `/ban` `/unban` `/banned` `/invite` `/verify` `/movie_update` `/pm_search` `/del_msg` `/delete` `/save` `/setskip`

Posting: `/post` `/bulkpost` `/autopost` `/postrange` `/ccopy` `/repost` `/postsettings` `/filecaption` `/setfilecaption` `/resetfilecaption` `/setwatermark` `/setlinktext` `/setdivider` `/setbutton` `/removebutton` `/resetpostformat`

### Owner-only commands (`OWNER_ID`) - `/owner_cmd`

These work **only** for the owner. Admins and users cannot run them, they are not in their `/` menu and the bot stays silent if they try.

`/system` `/logs` `/restart` `/maintenance` `/commands` `/broadcast` `/grp_broadcast` `/send` `/add_premium` `/remove_premium` `/get_premium` `/premium_users` `/add_redeem` `/trial_reset` `/leave` `/disable` `/enable` `/deletefiles` `/deleteall` `/clean_groups` `/resetallgroup` `/clear_junk` `/junk_group` `/delreq`

### Who sees what in the `/` menu
Set automatically at every start (and with `/commands`): users see only the user commands, group admins also see the group commands, bot admins also see the admin commands, the owner sees everything.

Indexing is handled by forwarding channel messages or sending supported Telegram message links to the bot in private chat.

## Public Repo Safety

<p>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Security-Keep%20Secrets%20Private-critical?style=for-the-badge" alt="Security">
</p>

- Do not commit `.env`, session files, logs, or virtual environments.
- Rotate any token or API key that was previously committed publicly.
- Keep real values only in your hosting provider environment variables.
- For public forks, avoid hardcoding shortener, TMDB, Telegraph, MongoDB, or Telegram credentials.

## Troubleshooting

### Bot does not start

Check that `BOT_TOKEN`, `API_ID`, `API_HASH`, `DATABASE_URI`, `LOG_CHANNEL`, and `ADMINS` are set correctly.

### MongoDB connection error

Check that `DATABASE_URI` is valid, the database user has access, and your hosting provider IP is allowed in MongoDB Atlas.

### Stream links are wrong

Set `FQDN`, `HAS_SSL`, and `NO_PORT` according to your hosting provider domain.

## Auto-post old files into private channels (`/autopost`)

Sends the files that are already saved in the database into private channels:
every movie / every web-series season is one **collection** (all qualities), a **sticker**
is sent when a collection is finished, then the next one starts.
Movies go to the movie channel, web series to the series channel.

1. Add the bot as **admin** in both private channels.
2. `/autopost movie -100xxxxxxxxxx` and `/autopost series -100yyyyyyyyyy`
3. Reply to a sticker with `/autopost sticker`, then `/autopost test`
4. `/autopost scan` (one collection per season) or `/autopost scan show` (one per series)
5. `/autopost start 5` to try 5 collections, then `/autopost start` for everything.

`/autopost stop`, `/autopost status`, `/autopost delay 2`, `/autopost cover on|off`,
`/autopost retry`, `/autopost clear confirm`. Progress is saved after every file and a
restart continues automatically. Roughly 20 files a minute is Telegram's limit, so a very
large library takes days.

### Time window (schedule) for posting
`/autopost schedule 10:00 22:00` - posts go out only between these two times (India time).
Overnight works too (`/autopost schedule 22:00 06:00`). Outside the window the bot waits and
continues by itself. `/autopost schedule off` = any time. The same window is used by `/postrange`.

## Copy posts between two numbers into another channel (`/postrange`)
The number of a post is the last number of its link (`t.me/c/1234567890/456` -> 456).

`/postrange <from_channel_id> <to_channel_id> <start> <end> [delay]`
e.g. `/postrange -1001111111111 -1002222222222 100 450`

Copies every post from `start` to `end` (both included, no "Forwarded from" tag; deleted numbers
are skipped). The bot must be admin in both channels. `/postrange status | stop | resume |
clear confirm`. Progress is saved and a restart continues automatically.


## Copy old videos from one private channel to another (`/ccopy`)

Reads a **source** private channel that holds many mixed old / new videos, builds one
**collection** per movie / per web-series season (old and new copies of the same title end up
together), keeps only these six qualities - `480p HEVC`, `480p`, `720p HEVC`, `720p`,
`1080p HEVC`, `1080p` (each at most once, per episode for series) - and **copies** them to the
destination channel **without the "Forwarded from" tag**. After every finished collection a
**sticker** is sent below it.

1. Add the bot as **admin** in both channels (the source must allow forwarding/saving content).
2. `/ccopy from -100xxxxxxxxxx` (source) and `/ccopy to -100yyyyyyyyyy` (destination)
3. `/ccopy sticker`, then send the sticker you like (the bot detects it). Then `/ccopy test`
4. `/ccopy scan` (the end of the channel is detected automatically, or `/ccopy scan <last message id>`)
5. `/ccopy start 5` to try 5 collections, then `/ccopy start` for everything.

**Post card mode:** `/ccopy mode card` posts ONE post card per collection instead of the video files
(poster + title / audio / genres box + download links of the max 6 qualities, the same card the bot
shows in PM search), and the sticker below it. The picked files are saved in the bot database
(if not already there) so the links work. `/ccopy mode files` goes back to copying the videos.

**Changing the sticker any time:** `/ccopy sticker` (then send any sticker) - or reply to a sticker with
`/ccopy sticker` - `/ccopy sticker show` shows the current one - `/ccopy sticker off` removes it.
The new sticker is used from the next finished collection. If no `/ccopy` sticker is set, the
`/autopost` sticker is used.

Other commands: `/ccopy stop | status | mode files|card | delay 2 | caption on|off | retry | clear confirm`.
`caption off` copies the videos without their caption. Progress is saved after every file and a
restart continues automatically. Collections that contain none of the six qualities are skipped.

The time window (`/autopost schedule 10:00 22:00`, India time) is also used by `/ccopy` and `/postrange`.

## Group protection (`plugins/antispam.py`)
In every group where the bot is **admin** (rights: *Delete messages* and *Ban users*):
* a **bot added by a user is banned** at once (only the bot owners in `ADMINS` may add bots), and the "X added a bot" line is removed;
* a message is **deleted immediately** when it has a **link** (any website, `t.me` channel / group / invite link, hidden text links, link buttons), an **@username mention**, or is a **forwarded message** - also when the link is added later by editing;
* **not touched:** group admins / owner, the bot owners, anonymous admins, other bots, the linked channel's automatic forward, `@thisbot` and links to this bot, plus everything in `ANTISPAM_ALLOWED` (and the bot's own `GRP_LNK`, `UPDATE_CHNL_LNK`, `SUPPORT_CHAT`);
* group admins switch it per group: `/antispam on | off | status` (status also shows whether the bot has the needed admin rights);
* a deleted message is not searched / answered by the other plugins.

Note: Telegram itself treats file names such as `movie.mov` or `file.zip` as web links, so a member who types such a name is treated like a link sender. Add the exact text to `ANTISPAM_ALLOWED` if that is a problem.
